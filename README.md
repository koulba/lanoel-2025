LANoÃ«l 2025 - Starter Project
=============================

Quick start:
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Start the server:
   npm start

Default admin credentials (created on first run):
- Email: thierrykoulba@gmail.com
- Password: Admin

Notes:
- This is a minimal starter. It provides:
  - User table with default admin
  - Admin panel to add games (with image upload), create teams, and enter results
  - Basic leaderboards
- Tailwind not integrated; simple CSS provides Apple-like black & white look.
- For production on Infomaniak, set up ENV variables and use PM2 or their Node hosting.
